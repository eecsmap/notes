I just noticed the existence of https://nbviewer.org/
which could render your http://github/eecsmap/notes pretty well as
https://nbviewer.org/github/eecsmap/notes

[Apparently I need to create a README](Apparently I need to create a README.ipynb) as the index file.

[I am not sure how to do it correctly. Let me google a bit how to create a ](I am not sure how to do it correctly. Let me google a bit how to create a .ipynb) loally.

This should be the main entry point to notes:
[https://nbviewer.org/github/eecsmap/notes/blob/master/README](https://nbviewer.org/github/eecsmap/notes/blob/master/README.ipynb)
